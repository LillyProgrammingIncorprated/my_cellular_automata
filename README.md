This is the latest verion of my own Conway's Game of Life. It now has many features that I coded in with my own blood, sweat, and unbritled rage. Features such as a custom size grid; editing the custom grid: drawing lines in all directions directly from the program; choosing how many times the game should iterate, and many more! It's shit but it works. 
TL;DR: It's just my own Game of Life I coded.
